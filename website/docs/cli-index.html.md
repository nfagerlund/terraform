# Terraform CLI Documentation

This is the documentation for Terraform CLI. It is relevant to anyone working
with Terraform's CLI-based workflows; this includes people who use Terraform CLI
by itself, as well as those who use Terraform CLI in conjunction with Terraform
Cloud or Terraform Enterprise.

> **Hands-on:** Try the [Terraform: Get Started](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/terraform/aws-get-started?utm_source=WEBSITE&utm_medium=WEB_IO&utm_offer=ARTICLE_PAGE&utm_content=DOCS) collection on HashiCorp Learn.

## What's in This Documentation?

This documentation focuses on the `terraform` command, and includes information
about all of the tasks and workflows that Terraform users perform on the
command-line. These tasks and workflows are divided into a handful of
categories, which are reflected in the navigation sidebar.

**This is not the only documentation you will need in order to use Terraform.**
Depending on the task at hand, you might need to consult some of the following:

- [Terraform Language Documentation](/docs/configuration/index.html) — 
  Terraform's primary user interface is the Terraform configuration language.
  Every Terraform user should be familiar with the language it uses to describe
  resources.
- [Terraform Cloud and Enterprise Documentation](/docs/cloud/index.html) — 
  Terraform Cloud (and its self-hosted form, Terraform Enterprise) is an
  application that helps teams use Terraform together. It implements many of the
  same Terraform workflows that Terraform CLI does, but handles some of them
  differently.
- [Provider References on the Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io) —
  All of Terraform's resource types are implemented by provider plugins.
  Providers are distributed on the Terraform Registry, and each provider's
  registry page includes documentation for its resource types and settings.

## Where Should You Start?

- **New user?** Try the
  [Get Started collection](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/terraform/aws-get-started?utm_source=WEBSITE&utm_medium=WEB_IO&utm_offer=ARTICLE_PAGE&utm_content=DOCS)
  at HashiCorp Learn, then return
  here once you've used Terraform to manage some simple resources.
- **Curious about Terraform?** See [Introduction to Terraform](/intro/index.html)
  for a broad overview of what Terraform is and why people use it.
- **Diving in?** The workflow categories in the navigation sidebar are arranged
  in the approximate order that a new user will encounter them. If you're
  looking for a specific command, use the alphabetical list, located near the
  bottom of the navigation sidebar.
