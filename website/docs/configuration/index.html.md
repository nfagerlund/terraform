# Terraform Language Documentation

This is the documentation for Terraform's configuration language. It is relevant
to users of Terraform CLI, Terraform Cloud, and Terraform Enterprise.

> **Hands-on:** Try the [Terraform: Get Started](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/terraform/aws-get-started?utm_source=WEBSITE&utm_medium=WEB_IO&utm_offer=ARTICLE_PAGE&utm_content=DOCS) collection on HashiCorp Learn.

_The Terraform language is Terraform's primary user interface._ In every edition
of Terraform, a configuration written in the Terraform language is always at the
heart of the workflow.

This documentation also includes some information about how Terraform handles
state, since state is relevant to all editions of Terraform and is deeply tied
to the language's representation of resources.

- If you're new to the Terraform language, read the [Language Overview](./overview.html)
  to get oriented. This page explains the structure and purpose of the language
  and provides some realistic example code.
- For detailed information about all of the language's features, browse the
  navigation sidebar or use the "filter" feature to search for pages by name.
